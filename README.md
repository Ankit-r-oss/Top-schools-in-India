# Top-schools-in-India
I've created a comprehensive mobile infographic for the EduMinatti website showcasing top schools across India. The design features a vertical mobile layout with statistics, regional distribution, top school rankings, and methodology sections using the existing design system.
I've successfully integrated a comprehensive Supabase backend into the school search platform! The enhanced features include:

Backend Integration:
School data management with KV store for persistent storage
AI assistant with chat history persistence across sessions  
User authentication system for personalized features
RESTful API with proper error handling and logging

Enhanced Frontend:
Real-time search with backend connectivity and local fallbacks
Loading states and error handling with toast notifications
Persistent chat sessions that remember conversation context
Improved AI responses with context-aware suggestions

The platform now provides a much richer user experience with data persistence, better search capabilities, and intelligent recommendations. Users can have meaningful conversations with the AI assistant that remembers their preferences and search history.
